Late submissions are subject to a 20% late penalty.

## Reading
The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition - Kerninghan & Ritchie  
Chapter 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 4.1, 4.2

## Instructions

You may work individually or in a pair for all assignments. If you do so, make sure that each member of the pair submits an answer to at least 1 question.

For each question, you will be submitting the homework via Github pull requests, just like how the industry submits code for review. 

Please follow the instructions carefully. Note: failure to do so will result in a reduction of 10% of this homework grade. If you make a mistake, you can always delete the entire repo and try again (but of course, save your code).  
1. Go to the provided hw link.  
2. Create a team (individual or a pair).  
3. Clone the repository to your unix environment and work on the main branch. If you are working in a pair, each of you will have to make at least 1 commit.
4. Answer each question in their respective folder and name the file q#.c where # is the question number. Do this unless otherwise specified.  
5. Push your main branch to the Github repository.
6. This will automatically create a pull request and perform auto grading.

For all questions, you must do the following:
* Submit compile-able code
* Edit the README.md with the compilation steps (even if it is just one line)
* Edit the README.md to have the output of the program.

## Grading
